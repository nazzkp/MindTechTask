This repository contains an Image Carousel App implemented using two different approaches:

ðŸ“‚ android_kotlin_xml_code â€“ Built using Kotlin with traditional XML layouts

ðŸ“‚ android_kotlin_compose_code â€“ Built using Jetpack Compose, Android's modern UI toolkit

Initially, I committed the code under the branches android_kotlin_xml and android_kotlin_compose for the XML and Compose versions respectively.
However, I noticed some issues while checking out those branches, so I created new branches:

android_kotlin_xml_code

android_kotlin_compose_code

These new branches work fine now.
ðŸ’¡ Tip: After switching branches, try "File â†’ Invalidate Caches ->Invalidate and Restart" in Android Studio for a smoother experience.

If you still face any problems checking out the branches, both projects are also available in my separate repositories:

->MindTechTaskXML

->MindTechTaskCompose
